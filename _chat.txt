[1/2/18, 10:40:29 pm] Mridul Karen FF: Haha I have never had coffee from 7/11
[1/2/18, 10:41:14 pm] Anubhav: Can you tell the difference between Cappuccino, latte and a flat white
[1/2/18, 10:41:30 pm] Mridul Karen FF: I only have cappuccino
[1/2/18, 10:41:34 pm] Anubhav: Like if I just give you coffee in regular take away cup
[1/2/18, 10:41:38 pm] Mridul Karen FF: Because I like my coffee very strong
[1/2/18, 10:42:01 pm] Mridul Karen FF: Latte I have tried it's not strong so I did not like it
[1/2/18, 10:42:33 pm] Anubhav: Aaah okay then I think it’s true that Sydney coffee is terrible
[1/2/18, 10:42:42 pm] Anubhav: I can’t tell the difference !
[1/2/18, 10:42:49 pm] Mridul Karen FF: Melbourne is known for its coffee
[1/2/18, 10:42:58 pm] Mridul Karen FF: Everywhere you go small small nice cafes
[1/2/18, 10:43:14 pm] Anubhav: That’s so cool !
[1/2/18, 10:44:05 pm] Mridul Karen FF: Haha yeah man
[1/2/18, 10:44:18 pm] Mridul Karen FF: I found Sydney to be expensive
[1/2/18, 10:44:25 pm] Mridul Karen FF: Even the food is expensive
[1/2/18, 10:45:44 pm] Anubhav: Oh yeah you are absolutely right !
[1/2/18, 10:46:01 pm] Mridul Karen FF: Melbourne food is so much cheaper and affordable
[1/2/18, 10:46:04 pm] Anubhav: Even the most mediocre of the places charge pretty big prices !
[1/2/18, 10:46:11 pm] Mridul Karen FF: Yeah exactly
[1/2/18, 10:46:16 pm] Mridul Karen FF: It's difficult for settling
[1/2/18, 10:46:31 pm] Mridul Karen FF: That's why people shift to Melbourne it seems
[1/2/18, 10:46:35 pm] Anubhav: Yes true ! Even the rent is not friendly !
[1/2/18, 10:46:44 pm] Mridul Karen FF: Like buying a house and all is easier in Melbourne
[1/2/18, 10:46:51 pm] Mridul Karen FF: Like your own house
[1/2/18, 10:47:17 pm] Mridul Karen FF: Sydney you will have to go somewhere in some remote suburbs to afford a house
[1/2/18, 10:47:47 pm] Anubhav: Very true ! I think around 600-700 buys you nice apartment near cbd in Melbourne ?
[1/2/18, 10:48:05 pm] Mridul Karen FF: Not sure many about the pricws
[1/2/18, 10:48:26 pm] Mridul Karen FF: But rent wise you can afford to stay in the city and enjoy the city life which is not possible in Sydney
[1/2/18, 10:48:34 pm] Mridul Karen FF: Sydney everyone stays in Suburbs
[1/2/18, 10:49:38 pm] Anubhav: Yeah :(  and the trains don’t do a great job of connecting to city as well
[1/2/18, 10:49:55 pm] Mridul Karen FF: Transportation is better in Sydney I felt
[1/2/18, 10:50:01 pm] Mridul Karen FF: Connectivity is better than Melbourne
[1/2/18, 10:50:17 pm] Mridul Karen FF: But again Sydney transportation is also more expensive than Melbourne
[1/2/18, 10:51:20 pm] Anubhav: I did think of moving to Melbourne once but then uni started and I just never experienced Melbourne !
[1/2/18, 10:51:45 pm] Mridul Karen FF: Haha university wise and job wise both Sydney has better opportunities
[1/2/18, 10:51:52 pm] Mridul Karen FF: So that was a good decision
[1/2/18, 10:52:07 pm] Anubhav: Thank you ! Makes me feel a little better ;)
[1/2/18, 10:53:00 pm] Mridul Karen FF: Haha you should feel good re

[15/2/18, 9:41:12 pm] Mridul Karen FF: Since you're doing studies and full time job together
[15/2/18, 9:41:21 pm] Mridul Karen FF: Will your experience count??
[15/2/18, 9:41:43 pm] Mridul Karen FF: Because officially that would be your college years right on your resume
[15/2/18, 9:41:50 pm] Anubhav: Yes :) in fact even the internship experience counts as experience
[15/2/18, 9:42:00 pm] Mridul Karen FF: Yeah
[15/2/18, 9:42:06 pm] Mridul Karen FF: But in your resume
[15/2/18, 9:42:15 pm] Mridul Karen FF: For those years you will be a student right
[15/2/18, 9:42:33 pm] Mridul Karen FF: How can you be both??
[15/2/18, 9:43:06 pm] Anubhav: Oh yeah but in the experience section I will be putting up all the work during these years !
[15/2/18, 9:43:45 pm] Anubhav: Surely they will ask about the role and everything but it’s a common thing
[15/2/18, 9:44:31 pm] Mridul Karen FF: So number of years of work experience will be years after college??
[15/2/18, 9:44:46 pm] Anubhav: Like lot of kids end up getting jobs in their last year so their experience starts then
[15/2/18, 9:45:10 pm] Mridul Karen FF: But yours will be almost for 3 years right??
[15/2/18, 9:45:43 pm] Anubhav: Ooooh I started in April 2016 so now
